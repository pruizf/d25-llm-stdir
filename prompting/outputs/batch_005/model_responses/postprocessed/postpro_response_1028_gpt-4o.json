  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Se dressant brusquement' translates to 'Standing up quickly' in English. This describes a character's movement, specifying a swift action of getting up. It does not imply an entrance, exit, interaction with objects or music, nor an aggressive action. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'movement' category as it describes the character's motion.",
