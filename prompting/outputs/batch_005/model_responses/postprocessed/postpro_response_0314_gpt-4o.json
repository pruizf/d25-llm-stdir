  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il crie.' translates to 'He shouts.' in English. Shouting can be considered a general action performed by the character, which does not necessarily fall under other specific categories like aggression or delivery. While shouting is an expression of emotion, and it might be tempting to classify it under 'delivery,' it lacks the nuanced context that would strongly indicate a vocal expression of emotion rather than it just being a loud action.",
