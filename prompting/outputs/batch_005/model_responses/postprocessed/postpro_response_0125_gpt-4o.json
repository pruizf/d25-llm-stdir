  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il frappe trois fois' ('He knocks three times' in English) falls under the category of general character actions. This is because 'frappe' (knock) is a verb that fits the description of typical actions included in category 0 'action.' It is not an aggressive act, so it does not fit category 1. No other category descriptions such as aside, delivery manner, entrance, exit, interaction, movement, music, narration, object, setting, or specifying an addressee closely apply here.",
