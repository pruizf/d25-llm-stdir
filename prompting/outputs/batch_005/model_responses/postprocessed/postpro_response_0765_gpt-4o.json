  "explanation": "The stage direction 'G\u00e9ronte s'approcha de la Dame, et lev\u00e9 sa cal\u00e8che.' describes G\u00e9ronte moving closer to the lady and then raising his carriage, which are actions related to movement and handling an object. However, the primary focus is on G\u00e9ronte approaching the lady, which fits the category of 'character movement.' Raising the carriage could indicate an interaction with an object, but the overall context emphasizes movement.",
