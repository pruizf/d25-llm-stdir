  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Entrant dans le corridor' translates to 'Entering the corridor' in English. While this action involves movement, it is not a character entering the main stage ('entrance') nor a character exiting the stage ('exit'). Instead, it indicates the character is moving into another area which fits well with 'movement'.",
