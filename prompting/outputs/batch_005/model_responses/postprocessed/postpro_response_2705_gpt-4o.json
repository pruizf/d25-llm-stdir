  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il va pour entrer chez son Colonel' indicates that the character is moving towards entering the place where their Colonel is located. It describes a deliberate movement ('va pour entrer'), but it does not confirm the actual entrance happening at that very moment. Therefore, it best aligns with the 'movement' category, as it describes the action of moving towards a goal.",
