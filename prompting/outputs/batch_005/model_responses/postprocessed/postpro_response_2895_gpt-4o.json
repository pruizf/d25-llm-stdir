  "explanation": "The stage direction 'En regardant les cartes' translates to 'Looking at the maps/cards' in English. This describes a general character action where a character is engaged in the act of looking at maps or cards. The action is not violent, does not involve vocal delivery, interaction with other characters, or manipulation of an object beyond the act of looking. Therefore, it best fits under the 'action' category.",
