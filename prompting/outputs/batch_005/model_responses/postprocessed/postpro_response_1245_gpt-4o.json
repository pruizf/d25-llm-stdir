  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Antelme s'en va' indicates that the character Antelme is leaving or exiting the stage. This is evident from the verb 's'en va,' which translates to 'goes away' or 'leaves' in English. This fits the definition of an exit where verbs like 's'en aller' and similar expressions are associated with a character exiting the stage.",
