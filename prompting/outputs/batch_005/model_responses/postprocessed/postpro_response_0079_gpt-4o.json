  "category": "5",
  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Elle sort suivie des guerriers et des femmes sauvages.' indicates that a character (Elle) leaves the stage. The verb 'sort' (exits) aligns with the definition of category 5 'exit.' This verb clearly aligns with the verbs mentioned in the definitions as related to characters exiting, such as 'sortir.' The direction also mentions who follows her, which does not change the primary action of exiting.",
