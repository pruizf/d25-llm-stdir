  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Ici un grand silence' indicates a pause or a moment of silence on stage. This kind of direction is not associated with a specific character action, interaction, movement, or emotion, but rather describes an atmosphere or moment during the play\u2014typically reflective of narrative elements intended for readers or directors to understand the context or mood. Hence, it fits best under 'narration'.",
