  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Ils parlent tous quatre en m\u00eame temps' indicates that four characters are speaking simultaneously. This describes a group interaction between the characters, even though it involves verbal communication. Since 'interaction' is defined as non-verbal character interaction, and 'delivery' covers variations in how things are said without suggesting concurrent interactions, neither perfectly fit. However, 'interaction' is closest as it involves multiple characters engaging in an activity together.",
