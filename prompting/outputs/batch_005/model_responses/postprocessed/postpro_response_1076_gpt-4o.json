  "explanation": "The stage direction 'M\u00eame air' translates to 'Same tune' or 'Same melody' in English, which indicates that the music should continue with the same musical theme. This fits squarely under the 'music' category, as it is describing the continuation of a particular tune and not the singing itself.",
