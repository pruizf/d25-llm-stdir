  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Apercevant leurs \u00e9p\u00e9es nues' describes a general character action of noticing or perceiving their unsheathed swords. This doesn't directly fit into categories like aggression (since it's about perceiving rather than using the swords aggressively), entrance, exit, or any other specific category. It is a general action of observation, which aligns best with the 'action' category.",
