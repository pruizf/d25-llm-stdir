        "content": "{\n  \"category\": 0,\n  \"explanation\": \"The stage direction 'Il frappe contre le mur' describes a general character action, which is knocking. This action is not violent, so it doesn't fit into category 1. It also doesn't involve the character addressing the audience or being alone, so it's not an aparte. The character is not entering or exiting, so those categories don't apply. It's not an interaction with another character, so category 6 is out. The character is not moving in a way that would fit category 7, and there's no mention of music or narration. The character is interacting with an object (the wall), so category 10 could be a good fit, but the description 'contre le mur' implies the action itself is more important than the object. Finally, the character is not setting a location or addressing someone, so categories 11 and 12 don't apply.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}"
