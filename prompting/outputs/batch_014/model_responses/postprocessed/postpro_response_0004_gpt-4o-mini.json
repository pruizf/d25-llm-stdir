  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il passe devant \u00c9velina' describes a movement action where the character is moving in relation to another character, \u00c9velina. This action fits well within the category of movement rather than other categories such as exit or entrance, as it does not indicate that the character is leaving or entering the stage, but rather moving past another character.",
