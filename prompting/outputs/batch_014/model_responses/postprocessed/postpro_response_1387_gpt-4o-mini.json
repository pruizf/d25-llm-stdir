  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Elle retourne sur le rocher' describes a movement action where the character is changing location by moving to a specific place (the rock). This fits well with the category of movement rather than other categories such as exit or entrance, as it does not indicate a full exit from the scene or an entrance into it.",
