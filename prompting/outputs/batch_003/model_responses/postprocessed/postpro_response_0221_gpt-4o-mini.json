  "explanation": "The term 'Ensemble' typically refers to a group of characters working together or interacting in a non-verbal manner during a performance. This aligns with the category of 'interaction', which includes non-verbal interactions among characters. Hence, ensemble signifies non-verbal collaboration or actions among multiple characters rather than a specific individual action or a defined entrance or exit.",
