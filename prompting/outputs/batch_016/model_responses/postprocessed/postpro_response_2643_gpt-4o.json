  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il chante en se promenant' describes the character singing while walking or moving around. While 'chanter' (to sing) could potentially fall under the 'delivery' category (since it relates to how the character expresses vocally), 'se promenant' (moving around) specifies a type of movement. Thus, the combination of actions leans more towards 'movement' since the character's primary action involves physical movement on stage.",
