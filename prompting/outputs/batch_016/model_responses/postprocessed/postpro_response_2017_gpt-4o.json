  "explanation": "The stage direction 'On entend de nouveau frapper \u00e0 la porte du fond.' describes an auditory event that is intended to provide narrative context for the scene. It refers to a sound ('frapper \u00e0 la porte') and gives an indication of its recurrence ('de nouveau'), which is more characteristic of a narrative description designed for the reader rather than an instruction for character action.",
