  "explanation": "The stage direction 'On entend tousser derri\u00e8re le th\u00e9\u00e2tre' describes a noise ('coughing') that is heard offstage. This is consistent with the 'narration' category, which refers to noises, weather events, or sequences of character actions. Since it explains what is heard rather than a direct action by a character, it fits the category of narration.",
