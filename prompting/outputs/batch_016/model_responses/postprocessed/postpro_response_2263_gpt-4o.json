  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Elle avale le poison' describes a general action performed by the character, specifically 'swallowing poison'. This is a specific character action that fits well within the definition of 'action' where verbs like drink and eat are mentioned\u2014 and 'swallowing' can be seen as a subset of these actions. There is no indication of violence that would categorize it under 'aggression', even though ingesting poison can lead to self-harm. Other categories do not describe this action accurately.",
