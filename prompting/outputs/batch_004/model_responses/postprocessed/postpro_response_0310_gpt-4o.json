  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il joint \u00c9tienne qui f\u00e9raille en reculant et se sauve' describes a character joining another character who is retreating while fighting, and then running away. This involves a movement but doesn't specify an entrance or exit explicitly. The primary action here is associated with movement ('joint', 'reculant', 'se sauve'). Therefore, it fits best into the 'movement' category.",
