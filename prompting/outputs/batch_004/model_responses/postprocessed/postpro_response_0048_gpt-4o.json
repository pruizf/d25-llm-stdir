  "explanation": "The stage direction 'On entend de nouveau frapper \u00e0 la porte du fond' translates to 'We hear knocking at the back door again'. This describes a sound that is part of the narrative quality of the scene rather than a specific character action. The description is akin to narrating an event happening on stage, fitting well within the 'narration' category as it describes noises important for the stage experience.",
