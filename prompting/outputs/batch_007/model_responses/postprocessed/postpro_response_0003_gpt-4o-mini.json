  "explanation": "The stage direction 'En voyant la porte ferm\u00e9e' indicates a character observing or reacting to a closed door, which implies a movement or physical response rather than just a static observation. It reflects a transition in how a character interacts with their environment, signalling that they are likely contemplating their next move based on the visualization of the door. This fits best under the category of movement.",
