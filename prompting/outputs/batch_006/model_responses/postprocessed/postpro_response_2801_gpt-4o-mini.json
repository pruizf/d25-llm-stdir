  "indicates a specific setting or environment within the play, describing the location where the action takes place. Therefore, it fits well into the category of setting, which is about stage description or play location. This is not an action or interaction but rather a description of the stage itself, prompting the audience to visualize the context of the scene. Additionally, 'champ' typically refers to a field or area, further emphasizing the description of a physical setting in the play.  Hence, I classified it under setting with confidence in this interpretation.  The repetition of similar or descriptive elements in stage direction can often lead to clearer categorization of context rather than action or movement.": "0.9",
