  "explanation": "The phrase 'On entend des clameurs en dehors' describes a sound that is outside the stage, which is consistent with a narrative quality often found in stage directions that provide context or atmosphere. It is not action, and it doesn't describe character movement, so it fits best in the narration category as it describes an audible event rather than a character's action.",
