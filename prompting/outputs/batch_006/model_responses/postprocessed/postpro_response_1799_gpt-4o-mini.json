  "explanation": "The stage direction 'On n'entend pas le reste' suggests that what follows is not heard or that there is a pause in dialogue or sound, which has a narrative quality as it indicates a break and allows for the audience to infer the situation. It resembles an interruption or silence in action, making it fit a narrational context rather than an action or dialogue.",
