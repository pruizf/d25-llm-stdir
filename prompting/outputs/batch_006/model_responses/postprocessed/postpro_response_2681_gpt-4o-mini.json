M\u00e9d\u00e9e continue.' describes general actions of two characters: Th\u00e9s\u00e9e picking up his sword and M\u00e9d\u00e9e continuing with her actions. These actions do not fit into the more specific categories of aggression, interaction, or others, making 'action' the most appropriate category.",
