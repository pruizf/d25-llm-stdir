  "explanation": "The phrase 'Jardinier ne vois-tu pas' indicates that the character is addressing another character directly, likely in a way that is meant to be understood by the audience as an aside or a moment of direct speech rather than a general dialogue. This fits the category of 'aparte' where a character speaks to themselves or directly to the audience, making them more privy to the character's thoughts or actions.",
