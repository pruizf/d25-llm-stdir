  "explanation": "The stage direction '\u00c0 Raton' indicates that a character is addressing someone (Raton) directly, which suggests that it is likely part of an entrance or an interaction rather than an exit or other action. It signifies that the character is coming in to engage with Raton or is being directed towards Raton in a way that disrupts the scene. This aligns closely with an entrance where a character acknowledges or addresses another character. Since it specifically points to Raton, it underscores a welcoming or addressing action typical of an entrance.",
