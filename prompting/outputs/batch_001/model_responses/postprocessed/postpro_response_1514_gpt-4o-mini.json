  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Cris au-dehors' indicates a sound (a cry) coming from outside, suggesting that it is likely meant to signal an entrance of a character or an event occurring off-stage that impacts the on-stage scenario. In theatrical terms, this aligns best with an entrance, as it often sets the scene for characters to enter in response to the external event.",
