  "explanation": "The phrase 'On n'entend pas le reste de la phrase' suggests that a character's speech is interrupted or not fully heard, which aligns with the definition of an 'aparte', where the character is indirectly addressing the audience while being aware they are not fully audible. This fits the scenario of a character having private thoughts or comments, making it more of an aside.",
