  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il lui parle \u00e0 l'oreille.' (He speaks to her in the ear) fits the 'aparte' category because it indicates that the character is addressing someone privately, often in a whisper, which is a typical characteristic of an aside. This is often used when a character wants to convey information that should not be heard by others on stage.",
