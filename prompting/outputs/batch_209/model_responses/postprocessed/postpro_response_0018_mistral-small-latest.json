  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Montrant l'huissier' indicates that a character is showing or pointing out the 'huissier' (usually a bailiff or officer of the court). This action typically involves a character's movement or gesture to direct attention toward another character or object. This fits best under the 'entrance' category as it implies the huissier is entering the stage or being made noticeable to the audience.",
