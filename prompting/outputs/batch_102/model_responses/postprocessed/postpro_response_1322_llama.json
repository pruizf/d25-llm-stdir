Il \u00e9coute des feuilles qui semblent r\u00e9gler leur froissement sur sa marche. Elles se taisent quand il s'arr\u00eate, et quand il repart, aussit\u00f4t elles craquent. C'est s\u00fbr que quelqu'un de mal intentionn\u00e9 suit le couple \u00e0 travers les arbres, en se cachant. Et Blanche qui, tout \u00e0 l'heure, s'effrayait sans raison, parle haut maintenant, laisse \u00e9clater une joie innocente, ne soup\u00e7onne rien et gourmande Maurice. \n\nCategory list:\n0. action\n1. aggression\n2. aparte\n3. delivery\n4. entrance\n5. exit\n6. interaction\n7. movement\n8. music\n9. narration\n10. object\n11. setting\n12. toward\n\nTo help classification, here is a definition for each category:\n\n- Category 0\n  - Name: action\n  - Definition: General character action.

Il \u00e9coute des feuilles qui semblent r\u00e9gler leur froissement sur sa marche.)\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9\n}\n\nI am 90% confident in my response because the stage direction is describing the character's actions and movements, which fits the definition of a movement stage direction. The other categories do not seem to fit as well, as there is no aggression, aparte, delivery, entrance, or exit described in the stage direction. The interaction is not non-verbal, as it involves the character listening to the leaves. The setting is not being described, and there is no music, narration, object, or toward mentioned."
