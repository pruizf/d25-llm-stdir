The presence of words like \"fouett\u00e9\" (whipped) and \"s'\u00e9crie\" (cries out) also suggests a violent and intense scene. While the stage direction also includes some descriptive language about the character's emotions and actions, the primary focus is on the violent action itself, making category 1 the most fitting choice."
