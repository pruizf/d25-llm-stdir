  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Elle le fait comme elle de dis' translates to 'She does it as she says.' This suggests a general character action rather than fitting into any of the more specific categories. It is not violent, nor does it involve an entrance, exit, interaction, movement, music, narration, object manipulation, setting description, or specifying an addressee. Therefore, it best fits the general 'action' category.",
