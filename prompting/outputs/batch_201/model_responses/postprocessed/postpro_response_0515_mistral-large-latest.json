  "explanation": "The stage direction 'S'\u00e9chauffant' translates to 'warming up' or 'getting heated' in English. This suggests a character movement or action that doesn't involve an entrance or exit but rather an ongoing action on stage. Since it doesn't fit more specific categories like aggression, interaction, or object manipulation, it best fits under the 'movement' category.",
