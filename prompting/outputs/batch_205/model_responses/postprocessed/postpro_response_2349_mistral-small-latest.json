The content following 'Air' is '14 : Voulez-vous savoir qui de deux.', which appears to be the title or description of a tune. This aligns with the definition of Category 8: 'Tune names (plays with songs). Music description. Not used when the stage direction describes the character singing. Often starts with the word \"AIR\" or \"Air\". If it starts with these words, it is most likely a music stage direction and the content following these words is the name of the tune.'",
