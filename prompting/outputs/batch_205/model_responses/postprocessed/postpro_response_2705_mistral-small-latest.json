  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il va pour entrer chez son Colonel.' describes the character's movement towards entering the Colonel's house. This movement is not an entrance (Category 4) as the character has not yet entered, and it is not an exit (Category 5) as the character is moving towards entering. Therefore, the best fitting category is 'movement' (Category 7).",
