  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il entend sa ma\u00eetresse.' translates to 'He hears his mistress.' This implies a movement or change in the character's state, specifically hearing, which is a form of perception or sensory action. It falls under 'movement' because it indicates a change in the character's state without being a physical movement on stage.",
