  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Se soulevant un peu' translates to 'slightly raising oneself' in English, which clearly describes a movement made by the character. This movement is not related to entering or exiting the stage, so it does not fall under categories 4 or 5. It is a general character movement, hence it best fits category 7.",
