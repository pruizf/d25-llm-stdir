  "explanation": "The stage direction 'AIR. Songez \u00e0 vous d\u00e9fendre.' starts with 'AIR', which is indicative of a music stage direction. The content following 'AIR' is the name or description of the tune, in this case, 'Songez \u00e0 vous d\u00e9fendre'. This fits the definition of Category 8: 'Music description. Not used when the stage direction describes the character singing. Often starts with the word 'AIR' or 'Air'. If it starts with these words, it is most likely a music stage direction and the content following these words is the name of the tune.'",
