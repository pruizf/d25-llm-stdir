  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Air Belle Brune, belle Brune.' clearly indicates a musical cue, as it starts with 'Air' followed by the name of the tune. This aligns with the definition of Category 8: 'Music description. Not used when the stage direction describes the character singing. Often starts with the word \"AIR\" or \"Air\". If it starts with these words, it is most likely a music stage direction and the content following these words is the name of the tune.'",
