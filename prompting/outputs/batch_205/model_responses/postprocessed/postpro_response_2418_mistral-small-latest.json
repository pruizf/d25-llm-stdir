  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Mais elle se met \u00e0 chanter, il \u00e9coute' involves the character starting to sing ('elle se met \u00e0 chanter') and another character listening ('il \u00e9coute'). This falls under the 'music' category because it describes the action of singing, which is not covered by other categories such as 'delivery' or 'interaction'.",
