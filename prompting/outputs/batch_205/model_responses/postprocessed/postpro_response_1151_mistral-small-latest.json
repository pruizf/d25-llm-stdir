  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Apr\u00e8s qu'il a lu' translates to 'After he has read.' This indicates a temporal sequence where the character performs an action (reading) and then the stage direction follows, suggesting a movement or action that occurs subsequent to the reading. This fits best into the 'movement' category as it involves the character moving on from one action to another.",
