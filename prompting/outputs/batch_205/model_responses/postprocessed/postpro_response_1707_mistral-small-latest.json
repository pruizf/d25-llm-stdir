  "explanation": "The stage direction 'S'arr\u00eatant' means 'stopping,' which is a clear indication of a character's movement on stage. This action does not involve entering or exiting, so it does not fall under categories 4 or 5. It is also not an interaction (category 6) or related to delivery manner (category 3). Therefore, the most fitting category is 'movement' (category 7).",
