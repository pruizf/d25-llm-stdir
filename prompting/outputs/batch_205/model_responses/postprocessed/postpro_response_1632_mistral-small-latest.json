  "explanation": "The stage direction '[\u00c0 tous.]' indicates a general action or address made by a character to everyone present on stage. This does not fit into any of the more specific categories such as entrance, exit, interaction, or aggression. It is a general character action that encompasses addressing an audience or a group, which falls under the 'movement' category as it involves the character directing their attention or action toward others.",
