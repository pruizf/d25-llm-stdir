  "explanation": "The stage direction describes Julie looking at the Marquis, looking up to the sky, and then leaving. The actions 'regarde' and 'l\u00e8ve les yeux au ciel' involve movements and interactions (looking), while 's'en va' signifies exiting. However, the primary focus is on the movements and non-exit/entrance actions, which fits best under 'movement'.",
