  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Il s'arrache de leurs bras' describes a movement where the character is forcefully removing himself from someone's grasp. This action does not fall under any of the more specific categories such as aggression (since it's not explicitly violent) or interaction (since it's not a non-verbal interaction). Therefore, it best fits under the 'movement' category.",
