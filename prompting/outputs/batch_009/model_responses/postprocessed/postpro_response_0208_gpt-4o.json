  "explanation": "The phrase 'Frappant du pied' translates to 'stamping one's foot,' which describes a physical movement of a character. It does not describe an entrance, exit, or an interaction with another character, nor does it have narrative qualities. Therefore, it best falls under the 'movement' category.",
