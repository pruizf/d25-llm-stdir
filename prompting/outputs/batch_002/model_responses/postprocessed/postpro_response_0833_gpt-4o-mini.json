  "explanation": "The term 'Aux Esprits' suggests that a character is addressing or making a direct reference to a spirit or otherworldly presence, which aligns with the definition of 'aparte' as it typically involves a character talking to themselves or the audience without others on stage being aware. This fits the context of an aside where the character could be sharing thoughts or dialogue not meant for the other characters.",
