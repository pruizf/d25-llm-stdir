  "explanation": "The stage direction 'Elle veut s'enfuir' translates to 'She wants to flee,' which indicates a desire or intention to move away or escape. This aligns with the category of 'movement' rather than any other category such as action or exit, since it specifically describes her intention to move rather than the action of exiting the stage or performing a general action.",
